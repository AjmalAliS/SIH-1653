SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. AI-Powered Question Generation
   * Dynamically generates relevant questions based on the candidate’s area of expertise, experience level, and job role.
   * Progresses from basic ice-breaking questions to in-depth techno-managerial discussions.
   * Uses NLP to ensure question diversity and depth.
     
2. Candidate Response Evaluation
   * AI-driven real-time assessment of candidate responses based on relevance, accuracy, depth, and confidence.
   * NLP-based semantic analysis to score responses based on keywords, concepts, and logical flow.
   * Possible speech-to-text analysis for spoken interviews.
     
3. Expert Score Calibration & Bias Minimization
   * Experts should receive a quantifiable metric for question quality and relevance.
   * The system can suggest better ways to refine or reframe questions for fairness.
   * Uses a bias-detection algorithm to flag repetitive or unfairly difficult questions.
     
4. Comprehensive Candidate Scoring
   * Generates an overall subject knowledge score based on both question difficulty and response relevance.
   * Includes both AI-generated evaluation and expert validation.
    
5. Boardroom Experience Simulation
   * Realistic video conferencing setup with AI-assisted moderation.
   * Virtual panel member avatars that guide and engage candidates naturally.
   * Can integrate VR or AR for an immersive experience (optional advanced feature).


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

System Components:
1️. Frontend (User Interface)
   * Web-based or mobile application for interviewers and candidates.
   * Video/Audio-enabled interview interface.
   * Dashboard for score visualization.
     
2️. Backend (AI & Processing Engine)
   * AI-driven Question Generator (based on candidate profile).
   * NLP-based Response Evaluator (to assess answers for accuracy & depth).
   * Bias Detection Model (to ensure fair question selection).
   * Final Score Computation (weighted score for candidate evaluation).

3️. Database
   * Stores candidate profiles, interview history, and scores.
   * Repository of categorized interview questions.
     
4️. Integration Layer
   * API-based communication between frontend and backend.
   * Speech-to-text engine (for spoken responses).
   * AI-powered analytics dashboard.
